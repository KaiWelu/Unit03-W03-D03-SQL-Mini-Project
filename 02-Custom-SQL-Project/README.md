# **Custom Java + PostgreSQL Project**  

## **Project Requirements**  
You will design and implement your own **Java + PostgreSQL** application. While you have creative freedom, your project **must** meet the following technical requirements:  

### **Mandatory Requirements:**  
✅ **Database Connection:** Use the **PostgreSQL JDBC driver** to connect your Java application to a PostgreSQL database.  
✅ **Connection Pooling:** Use **HikariCP** for efficient database connection pooling.  
✅ **Tables & Relationships:** Your database must have at least **three tables** with proper **relationships (PK, FK, constraints, etc.)**.  
✅ **CRUD Operations:** Implement **full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on at least **one of your tables**.  
✅ **Pagination:** Use **OFFSET and LIMIT** to paginate results.  

### **Bonus Requirements (Optional but Encouraged):**  
➕ **Filtering & Searching:** Implement search functions that allow users to filter data based on specific conditions.  
➕ **Aggregation Functions:** Use **PostgreSQL aggregation functions** (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).  
➕ **Grouping Data:** Implement a **GROUP BY query** (e.g., grouping by clients to see which clients have spent the most money).  
➕ **Date and Time Functionality:** Functionality for working with date and time.
➕ **CASE Statements:** Work with case statements in Postgres to get a cleaner display.





Take this opportunity to **be creative!** Think of an application that interests you, whether it's an **inventory system, a booking system, or a finance tracker**—as long as it meets the requirements above.
